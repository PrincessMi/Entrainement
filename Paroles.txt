We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby

We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)


Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover




Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
